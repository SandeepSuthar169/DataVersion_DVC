1. Create fit repo.
2. Create Code.oy and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a dit add, commit, push, before initializating DVC.
4. pip install DVC.
5. how i do "dvc" init (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. now do "mkdir s3" (creates a new s3 directory)
7. now we do "dvc remore add - myremote s3"
8. Next "dvc add data/"
   now it will ask to do : ("git rm -r --cached 'data' and "git commit -m "stop tracking data")
   before initializating i were tracking data/ folder git so now i remove it for DVC ot handl.
9. Again i do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitinore data.dvc"
10. Now :-> "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" 
11. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
12. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
13. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
